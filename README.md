> Deep Learning-based F1 Driver Performance Classification using Telemetry Data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project classifies Formula 1 drivers based on their **driving style and performance**, using **telemetry data** such as throttle, brake, speed, gear, and RPM. The goal is to build a model that can identify whether a driver is **aggressive**, **conservative**, or **balanced**, based on lap-level data.

This project was built for the course **CMPE 471/CMPS 479: Deep Learning** at Qatar University.
